                <p>
                  I&apos;m Jeet — a developer who took the long, quiet route into tech. My
                  postgraduate work in <span className="text-foreground">MCA (Cyber Security)</span>
                  taught me to look at software not just as features, but as systems with people on
                  the other end.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Somewhere between debugging Express APIs at 2am and chasing logs in a SIEM lab, I
                  realized I didn&apos;t want to pick one. I wanted to build, secure, and teach.
                </p>
                <p>
                  GhostCode Dynamics is the answer to that — a small, founder-led brand that ships
                  real digital work for businesses while staying close to the student community I
                  came from.

                  thinking about resilience.

                  Build small things that work. Tell the truth about timelines. Treat students like
                  future peers, not customers. And keep learning — always.
