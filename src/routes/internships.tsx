    q: "Is it paid?",
    a: "The first cohorts are unpaid but genuinely educational, with a stipend planned as client capacity grows. We will never charge students to intern.",

  {
    q: "Do I need to be a computer science student?",
    a: "No. You need working fundamentals in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and the discipline to finish what you start.",

  {
    q: "Is it remote?",
    a: "Yes, remote-first with scheduled review calls. Time zones inside India are easiest, but we consider everyone.",
