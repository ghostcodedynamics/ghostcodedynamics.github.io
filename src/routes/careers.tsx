    q: "Do you take students with no experience?",

  {
    q: "Is the work paid?",
    a: "Collaborator work tied to client projects is paid. Learning-only programmes such as internships and the Academy are separate and clearly labelled.",

    q: "How do I apply?",
    a: "Send a short note with links to what you've built. One paragraph about why this studio, and we'll read all of it.",
